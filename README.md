# MRI-Histology_framework_for_SWM_architecture
This repository contains analysis notebooks for studying SWM microstructure using post-mortem and in-vivo datasets. It includes preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization scripts to assess intensity profiles from all datasets, gradients from qMRI, and their correlations with cortical geometry, functional and structural connectivity.
